/**
 * Converts a MediaStatus object to a Map representation suitable for Flutter.
 * 
 * This extension function transforms a Google Cast MediaStatus object into a map
 * that can be easily serialized and passed to the Flutter layer. It extracts
 * all relevant media playback state information.
 * 
 * @return Map<String, Any?> A map containing the following keys:
 *   - activeTrackIds: Array of currently active track IDs (subtitles, audio tracks, etc.)
 *   - currentItemId: ID of the currently playing queue item
 *   - idleReason: Reason why the player is idle (if applicable)
 *   - isMute: Boolean indicating if the player is muted
 *   - isPlayingAd: Boolean indicating if an advertisement is currently playing
 *   - loadingItemId: ID of the item currently being loaded
 *   - mediaInfo: String representation of the current media information
 *   - playbackRate: Current playback rate (1.0 = normal speed)
 *   - playerState: Current state of the media player
 *   - preloadedItemId: ID of the preloaded queue item
 *   - queueItemCount: Total number of items in the queue
 *   - queueRepeatMode: Current repeat mode for the queue
 *   - streamVolume: Current volume level of the stream
