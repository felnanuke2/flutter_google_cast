## 1.3.1 - Swift Package Manager Fixes
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **SPM Build Fixes**: Fixed Swift compiler errors when building with Swift Package Manager
  - Added missing `import Flutter` statements to all method channel Swift files
  - Added `@objc(GoogleCastPlugin)` attribute to expose Swift plugin class with correct name for Flutter's plugin registrant
  - Fixes "Cannot find type 'FlutterPlugin' in scope" and related compiler errors
  - Fixes "Unknown receiver 'GoogleCastPlugin'" error in GeneratedPluginRegistrant.m

### 🔧 Notes
- SPM support now fully functional for iOS builds
- No breaking API changes

## 1.3.0 - Swift Package Manager Support
### ✨ New Features
- **Swift Package Manager (SPM) Support**: Added full SPM support for iOS
  - Added `Package.swift` manifest with [SRGSSR/google-cast-sdk](https://github.com/SRGSSR/google-cast-sdk) dependency
  - Plugin now supports both CocoaPods and SPM for iOS dependency management
  - Resolves pub.dev scoring requirement for SPM support

### 🔧 Platform Changes
- **iOS Deployment Target**: Updated minimum iOS version from 14.0 to 15.0 (required by GoogleCast SPM package)

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README with SPM usage instructions
- Added SPM documentation to podspec

## 1.2.9 - iOS Cast contentURL fix
### 🐛 Fixes
- Use `GCKMediaInformationBuilder(contentURL:)` instead of deprecated `contentID` to align with current Google Cast SDK and fix media load failures (including HLS) on iOS.

## 1.2.8 - iOS HLS & Media Safety
### 🐛 Fixes
- Hardened iOS media parsing to avoid crashes from missing/invalid metadata; `fromMap` now bails out safely and treats infinite/NaN durations as zero.
- Improved HLS playback support by mapping segment formats, honoring `startAbsoluteTime`, and correctly propagating `playPosition`, `startTime`, and `preloadTime` values.
- Queue load options now respect fractional play positions, keeping live and buffered streams in sync.

### 🧭 UX
- Tweaked expanded player and mini controller behavior for live streams (slider, play/pause), improving control feedback during HLS playback.
