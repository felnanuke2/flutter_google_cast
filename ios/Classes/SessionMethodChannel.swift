/// Flutter method channel for individual Google Cast session operations
/// 
/// This class handles method calls related to individual Cast session operations,
/// such as device-specific controls during an active session. It provides a
/// bridge between Flutter's session control API and the native Google Cast SDK
/// session functionality.
///
/// Key features:
/// - Individual session device controls
/// - Session-specific volume management
/// - Real-time session operation handling
/// - Extensible for additional session-level operations
///
/// This class complements the `FGCSessionManagerMethodChannel` by focusing on
/// operations that occur within an established session, rather than session
/// lifecycle management.
