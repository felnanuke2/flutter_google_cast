// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.
//
// This Package.swift enables Swift Package Manager (SPM) support for the flutter_chrome_cast plugin.
// The plugin maintains dual support for both CocoaPods (via flutter_chrome_cast.podspec) and SPM.
//
// The Google Cast SDK dependency is provided by the SRGSSR community wrapper since Google does not
// officially provide an SPM-compatible distribution.
//
// Note: SPM support includes only Swift sources. The Objective-C bridging code (GoogleCastPlugin.m/h)
// is used by CocoaPods and Flutter's build system handles plugin registration automatically.
