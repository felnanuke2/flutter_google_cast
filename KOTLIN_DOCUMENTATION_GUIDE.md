 * 3. Monitor connection status via SessionManagerListener
 * 4. Report connection status to Flutter
 *
 * @param deviceId The unique identifier of the Cast device to connect to
 * @param options Optional connection parameters for session customization
 * @return `true` if connection initiation was successful, `false` otherwise
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if deviceId is null or invalid format

 * @since Android API 21 (Android 5.0)
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val success = startSession("device_123", null)
 * if (success) {
 *     // Monitor SessionManagerListener for actual connection status
 * }
 * ```
 */
@Throws(IllegalArgumentException::class, SecurityException::class)
fun startSession(deviceId: String, options: CastOptions?): Boolean {
    // Implementation
}
```

## üîÑ Flutter-Specific Documentation

### Method Channel Handlers

```kotlin
/**
 * Handles method calls from the Flutter side
 * 
 * Processes incoming method calls for [specific functionality area].
 * Each method corresponds to a specific Cast operation with proper
 * error handling and result reporting back to Flutter.
 *
 * Supported methods:
 * - `methodName1`: Description of what it does and expected parameters
 * - `methodName2`: Description of what it does and expected parameters
 * - `methodName3`: Description of what it does and expected parameters
 *
 * Error handling:
 * All method calls include proper error handling with standardized
 * error codes and messages returned to Flutter for consistent
 * error reporting across the plugin.
 *
 * @param call The Flutter method call containing method name and arguments
 * @param result Callback to return results, success, or errors to Flutter
 * @since Android API 21 (Android 5.0)
 */
override fun onMethodCall(call: MethodCall, result: MethodChannel.Result) {
```

### Listener/Callback Methods

```kotlin
/**
 * Called when [specific event] occurs in the Cast SDK
 * 
 * This callback method is invoked by the Google Cast SDK when [condition].
 * It processes the event, updates internal state as needed, and notifies
 * Flutter of the state change for UI updates.
 *
 * Event processing:
 * 1. Validate event data and session state
 * 2. Update internal component state
 * 3. Convert event data to Flutter-compatible format
 * 4. Notify Flutter via method channel invocation
 *
 * @param manager The Cast SDK manager instance that triggered the event
 * @param data The event data from the Cast SDK
 * @since Android API 21 (Android 5.0)
 */
override fun onEventCallback(manager: CastManager, data: EventData) {
```

### Data Conversion Methods

```kotlin
/**
 * Converts [SourceType] to a Flutter-compatible Map
 * 
 * This extension function serializes [source type] properties into a Map
 * format suitable for transmission to Flutter via method channels. All
 * properties are safely converted to Flutter-compatible types with proper
 * null handling.
 *
 * Map structure:
 * - `key1`: Description of key1 and its data type
 * - `key2`: Description of key2 and its data type
 * - `key3`: Description of key3 and its data type
 *
 * Type conversions:
 * - Explain any special type conversions
 * - Note handling of null values
 * - Describe enum to string conversions
 *
 * @return Map containing all properties for Flutter consumption
 * @receiver SourceType The Cast SDK object to convert
 * @since Android API 21 (Android 5.0)
 */
fun SourceType.toMap(): Map<String, Any?> {
```

## üìã Code Organization

### Package-Level Documentation

```kotlin
/**
 * Google Cast plugin extensions for Android
 * 
 * This package contains extension functions that provide Flutter-compatible
 * data conversion for Google Cast SDK objects. These extensions ensure
 * consistent data representation across the Flutter-Android bridge.
 *
 * Key extensions:
 * - CastDevice.toMap(): Device information conversion
 * - MediaInfo.toMap(): Media metadata conversion
 * - Session.toMap(): Session state conversion
 *
 * @author LUIZ FELIPE ALVES LIMA
 * @since Android API 21 (Android 5.0)
 */
package com.felnanuke.google_cast.extensions
```

### Section Documentation

```kotlin
// MARK: - Flutter Plugin Lifecycle

/**
 * Flutter plugin lifecycle methods
 * 
 * These methods handle the attachment and detachment of the plugin
 * to the Flutter engine, ensuring proper resource management and
 * cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
 */

// MARK: - Google Cast SDK Integration

/**
 * Google Cast SDK integration methods
 * 
 * These methods interface directly with the Google Cast SDK for Android,
 * handling Cast-specific operations and translating between Cast SDK
 * data structures and Flutter-compatible formats.
 */
```

## üéØ Quality Standards

### Good Documentation Example

```kotlin
/**
 * Flutter method channel for Google Cast device discovery operations
 * 
 * This class manages the discovery of Google Cast devices on the local network using
 * Android's MediaRouter framework. It handles device discovery lifecycle, maintains
 * discovered device state, and communicates device availability changes to Flutter.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Cast device discovery management (start/stop)
 * - Real-time device availability monitoring
 * - Device state synchronization with Flutter
 * - Integration with Android MediaRouter framework
 *
 * Architecture:
 * The class uses Android's MediaRouter system to discover Cast devices:
 * - MediaRouter: Core Android component for device discovery
 * - MediaRouteSelector: Defines criteria for Cast device discovery
 * - DiscoveryRouterCallback: Handles device discovery events
 *
 * @author LUIZ FELIPE ALVES LIMA
 * @since Android API 21 (Android 5.0)
 */
class DiscoveryManagerMethodChannel : FlutterPlugin, MethodChannel.MethodCallHandler {
```

### Poor Documentation Example (Avoid)

```kotlin
// Discovery manager
class DiscoveryManagerMethodChannel : FlutterPlugin, MethodChannel.MethodCallHandler {
    
    // Channel
    lateinit var channel: MethodChannel
    
    // Handle calls
    override fun onMethodCall(call: MethodCall, result: MethodChannel.Result) {
        // Do something
    }
}
```

## üîç Documentation Tools

### Android Studio Integration

- Use Android Studio's Quick Documentation (Ctrl+Q) to verify documentation appears correctly
- Documentation comments should appear in autocomplete
- Ensure proper formatting in Quick Documentation popup

### Validation

```bash
# Generate documentation (if using Dokka)
./gradlew dokkaHtml

# Run lint checks
./gradlew lint

# Check code style
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```

### KDoc Standards

Follow KDoc conventions:
- Use `/**` for documentation comments
- Use `@param`, `@return`, `@throws` for structured documentation
- Include `@since` for API level requirements
- Use `@see` for cross-references
- Provide code examples in triple backticks

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Kotlin-Specific Documentation

1. **Null Safety**: Clearly document nullable types and null handling
2. **Extension Functions**: Document receiver type and extension purpose
3. **Coroutines**: Document suspend functions and threading behavior
4. **Data Classes**: Document property meanings and constraints
5. **Sealed Classes**: Document all possible subclasses and use cases

### Android-Specific Considerations

1. **Lifecycle**: Document Android lifecycle dependencies
2. **Permissions**: Note required permissions and runtime requests
3. **Threading**: Specify which thread methods should be called on
4. **Memory**: Document memory management and leak prevention
5. **API Levels**: Specify minimum and target API requirements

This documentation style ensures that all Kotlin code in the Flutter Google Cast plugin is professionally documented, maintainable, and accessible to both current and future contributors working on the Android implementation.
